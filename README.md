# CSCI160-CQ4
let O be the time complexity and T be the space complexity. 

camelCase:  O(n) where n is the length of the string s because the code iterates through the entire string that is length n. 
            T(1) because we are only storing 1 variable called counter that we keep on updating which takes constant work regardless of the size of the input array. 

Correctness:  O(n) where n is the length of the input array because we iterate the array of length n. 
              T(1) similarly to the camelCase, we have 3 variables of value, j and i which takes up certain space but because that space does not depend on the size of the array, its takes constant space.
